# Codebase API Gateway

This repository contains an API Gateway service, which acts as an intermediary
between the client and the Codebase platform. The service decorates the
responses from the Codebase API platform with additional metadata and changes
the response format from XML to JSON.

To use this service, you need a [Codebase](https://www.codebasehq.com/) account. 

Se the included [API documentation](https://github.com/petertornstrand/cbapi/blob/main/cbapi.openapi.json) for more information.
